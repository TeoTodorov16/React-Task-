## How I worked on this project

- I followed all the rules in the Task and forked the original project (public).
- Made an Account in BitBucket to commit to the local repository.
- I built this app based on the provided UI/UX designs.
- I used the master branches and Pull Requests.
- pushing new changes into the bitbucket repo as I progress through the task.
- Created a responsive web application from the provided design and integrated it with an existing API's.

## How to navigate this project

- Somewhat complex stateful logic.
- Responsive CSS.
- Used API's for BackEnd.
â€‹
## Why i built the project this way
- I didn't use a state management library like Redux on purpose. For this app simple `useState` is sufficient. I realized that more and more projects don't use Redux anymore since GraphQL or react-query are often used for data management.

- I'm still trying to find my style, but I definitely lean toward plain .css with strict naming like component wrappers ect ect.
Totally game to practice with something different for the project.However I am planning on using styled components in the future (especially if the company require so)

- Learned and Applied - The Redirection between the pages is built by the help of React Router - navigation tool

- I used CamelCase because i built this as a practice in my code -  it will ensure that there aren't multiple variables with the same name.

- I read in the Additional information - ""Settings" page and "Recover password" button are solely with a visual purpose. But I couldn't take a hold of myself and did a simple form just to not let the button completely empty and nonfunctioning.

## If I had more time I would change this

- Refactor some of the code.
- Probably Use Redux for State Management.
- Learn and Implement TypeScript into the Project.
- Make some changes in the css to style it perfectly as the example.
- Get rid of the Overflow.
- Implement the Show/Hide icon for Password validation not only on the Recover Password but in the Login Form as well. Icon is taken from - React icons by installing new package in JSON file and import it afterwords. (already had it but didnt have the time to refactor the css to change the whole input).
- Add Testing Library.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
